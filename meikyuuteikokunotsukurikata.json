Even worse, the world is already on track towards a bad ending. \n\nDetermined to avoid the worst outcome, Nino takes action, but he is soon falsely accused and exiled to a remote frontier. However, this village holds a secret that only he knowsâ€”there's a hidden dungeon here! \n\nNow, with the perks of being a reincarnator and his vast knowledge of the game's mechanics, Nino begins his ideal frontier life!",
