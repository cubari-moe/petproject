  "description": "Aria, a former high school student, reincarnated as a young lady of an unremarkable noble house.  \n  \nShe was roped into attending a marriage interview with Prince Eugene, who's rumored to be an oddball, and it’s during this meeting that he suddenly makes a ridiculous claim — that he was Oda Nobunaga in his past life!!  \n  \n*Well, that explains why the Prince still has yet to find a partner.*  \n  \nHowever, Aria calmly accepts Eugene’s tall tale, which inevitably piques his curiosity…   \n  \n*That won’t do! What if he finds out that I, too, have memories from my past life?!*  \n  \nThus begins Aria’s days of being aggressively courted by the world’s most powerful prince who’s capable of unifying entire nations!",
