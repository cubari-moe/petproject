  "description": "When I was suddenly summoned to another world by some mysterious identity that said, \"Pick three Skill Seeds\". But wait, what does 'Skill Seeds' mean instead of just 'Skills'? Realizing the sole difference between the two, I awakened as the other world's first 'Hacker', capable of arbitrarily enhancing skills by manipulating their values! To start, I manipulated the skills of a beautiful girl, Mia, who suffered due to her skills being unsuitable for combat and joined forces with her to surpass those who had looked down on us!",
